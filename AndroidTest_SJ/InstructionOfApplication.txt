PART ONE
   - Time arrangement

Feb 5
	Start project. 
	1. Reading instruction, go through all resources, mark points that needs to be done.
	2. List all requirements and plan a sequence of them.
	3. Meet problems.
		a. When I go through the project resource, I found this is Gradle project.
			- install gradle plugin and tools into Eclipse <Still can not import>
			- change ADT into Android Studio. <no issues at first>
			- start coding and cannot test the project 
			  <"android studio compilation failed see the compiler error output for details">
			- since it cost me a long time, I decide to create new project in Eclipse and copy all code into the new project  


Feb 6 and Feb 7 
	Update SDK and tools in Eclipse Juno. I met three big issues.
	1. API 20 and 19 reversion failure. 
		- finding issue and fixing it by close all project in Eclipse
	2. android_support_v4 can not be delete/rewrite/...
		- remove from project and re-add <Failure>
		- find another error-- no resource found in appcompat_v7/.../...
	3. appcompat_v7 keep shows errors
		- delete appcompat_v7 then new a project to generate it. <Failure>
		- remove appcompat_v7 from properties then re-add in project <Failure>
		- comment all errors in appcomapt_v7 <Failure>
		- select API 21/20/19/14 as target <Failure>
		- set target = android-21 and minSDK=21 in Manifest then solve the problem
